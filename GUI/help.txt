/// 1. MOVING AROUND ///
This is simple program, which have only 3 bars in menubar. All of the calculations are automatic. Bars which you can use, are: File, Run, Info.

### File -> New ###
Here you can create new file, where you going to insert data. If you have found some interesting data on the Internet, you can copy and paste it here.
Remember, that data which you entered there, must fulfill conditions referred in second point - Prepare files.
### File -> Save ###
If you have already entered data in new created file, or correct file which you open. You can save, using this bar.
### File -> Open ###
You can open files here. Remember, program is going to avoid different extension then .csv or .txt
### File -> Quit ###
If you did already all the calculations, you can exit from program there.

### Run -> BLUP ###
Actually this is the only one method you can use in this program. After picked one of two required files, you can move there and program
automaticly going to ask you for second file. When it's done, you can choose h^2 value, which represent value of the heritability.
When it's done, and you see both files in program, click Ranking button to estimate breeding values. In right window you going to see
animal ranking sorted from biggest. By clicking plot and pearson after it, you are going to find more information about this data.

### Info ###
Here you can find all the information, it is not necessary to check it, but we will be glad if you check license.


/// 2. PREPARE FILES ///
There should be two files, one represent animal pedigree, another breeding values and herd. Values should be separated by tab.
Below you can find examples of files.

### PEDIGREE FILE ###

animal  sire    dam
216     14      70
217     12      17
218     6       106

### DATA FILE ###

animal	protein	herd
216     194.93	2
217     203.92	3
218     197.12	1

### IMPORTANT THINGS ###
Pedigree file should contain three columns, first represent animal number, second is father number, third is mother number.
Structure should not be edited here, insert data by creating new lines. Animal number is not need to be sorted.

In data file animal numbers is not need to be sorted either. In place of protein, you can write any breeding value name, which you want to estimate. If there is only one herd, please write 1 in every rows of this column.

### NOT ACCEPTABLE DATA ###
Data like "animal" "sire" "dam", where title or data are in apostrophe or brackets are not allowed. Program will command to
change it before calculations.

/// 3. SCRIPT TO USE CALCULATIONS WITHOUT GUI ///

import pandas as pd
from calculations import Calc

data = pd.read_csv('yourpedigreefile.txt', sep='\t')
data2 = pd.read_csv('yourbreedingfile.txt', sep='\t')
h2val = 0.64

datasi = Calc().datasire(data, data2)
ranking = Calc().rankingchange(h2val, datasi[0], datasi[1], datasi[2])
pearson = Calc().Pearson(ranking[1], ranking[2])
plot = Calc().makeplot(ranking[1], ranking[2])

print(pearson)
